========== Week Five ==========

This week focused on learning how to use forward and reverse kinematics to position the robot using odometry. Using many equations and some calibration, we were able to tell the robot to move to a position in an x-y grid with a target heading. In the lab, we had to drive to multiple set locations repeatedly without losing position tracking.
