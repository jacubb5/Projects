========== UNDER CONSTRUCTION ==========

This repository contains work from a course or project I have already completed or am actively working on. The full technical write-up and supporting materials have not yet been added, but they will be published here once the documentation is finalized.

I prefer to publish a clean, accurate record of the work rather than incomplete or rushed notes. If you were directed here from my resume or portfolio and would like more context about the project or coursework in the meantime, feel free to contact me at jacubb5@outlook.com.

Thank you for your patience.
