========== Repository Description ==========

This repository contains documentation and technical summaries for projects I have completed or am actively developing during my time at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. These projects span areas such as electronics, embedded systems, mechanical design, and robotics, and are intended to demonstrate both my engineering process and the final results.

Each project folder includes a description of the problem being solved, the approach and design decisions that were made, and what I learned from the process. Some entries are still being documented in more detail, but all represent real work that was built, tested, and iterated on.

If you are reviewing this repository from my resume or portfolio and would like additional technical details, design files, or context for a specific project, feel free to contact me at jacubb5@outlook.com. I am always happy to discuss my work.

Thank you for taking the time to look through my projects.
